# Update Documentation

## Overview
This track focuses on bringing the project documentation up to date with the current state of the codebase. Specifically, it addresses inconsistencies in the `README.md` regarding the project structure and ensures all configuration options are accurately documented.

## Goals
- Update `README.md` to reflect the correct file names (e.g., `telegram_notifier.py`).
- Include missing components in the documentation (e.g., `x_notifier.py`).
- Verify and update configuration instructions for all notifiers.
- Ensure the `TELEGRAM_ENABLED` flag is documented.

## Scope
- `README.md`
- `conductor/` documentation (if applicable)

## Non-Goals
- Code refactoring (unless minor inconsistencies are found).
